1.Git 
2.version control system
3.Types of version control system
4.History 
5.Basic git commands 

GIT(global information tracker) :
----------------------------------------
Git is distributed version control system..

version control system (vcs):
-----------------------------
whatsapp :- chats :- v1 
            chats,calls :- v2
            chats,calls,status :- v3 Working beautifully 
            chats,calls,status,payment :- v4 Roll back 

roll back:- When the new update is not working fine at that time easliy
            we can switch back to older version....


childs :- baby sitting
          lkg,ukg
          1-10 th 
          11-12 puc
          13-16 degree

Software development life cycle 

Requirements

Devlopers starts a writting code 

1st day :- 50 lines of code :- 1 class completed 
2nd day :- 50 lines 

=========================================================
Types of version control system :
----------------------------------------
1.Local version control system.
2.Centralised version control system.
3.Distributed version control system.

1.Local version control system:- 
--------------------------------------------------
The updates will be stored in a local system 

Drwaback ;
-----------------
If anything happens to the local system the complte source code will be 
gon there will be no chances of backup and all ...

To oversome this drawback we are havin Centralised version control system 

2.Centralised version control system:-
---------------------------------------------
Multiple Devlopers are working with Centralised version control system.
on the daily basis....

Drawback:-
----------------
If anything happens to the central server we will be not having a backup 
of the sorce code compltely it as gon...... 

3.Distributed version control system:-
--------------------------------------------
The source code will be stored among multiple developers they can get 
a updates of other developers source code...

->No need of internet connection but when they are working with Remote 
  repository at that time they required a internet connection ...

local  :- only one copy of source code if anything happens to that the system 
           there is a no chances getting the source ...

central :- Multiple developers can work on the project ..

SVN :- sub version 

distributed :- mutiple developers can work and the source codes mutiple 
               copy also availble ....

============================================================================
Git :- Git is developed by linus torvalds in 2005

Linux :- linux is written in c lang  

Repository :
------------------
Repository is nothig it is a one kind of directory 

1.working directory :- where we were working ..

Ajit has a written some source code 

2.staging area :- tracking and for review 

3.Local repository

4.Remote Repository

Git commands :
--------------------
1.git init :- It is used to create a repositroy in our local system...

syntax :- git init or git init <repository name>

NOTE :- When ever we create a repository at that time local repo will be
        created with the name of .git ......

2.git status :- it will give us a result on current branch status
                (whether the files tracking or not)

synatx :- git status

3.git add :- to add a file from working directory to staging area

syntax :- git add <file-name> or git add .

To configure user name and mail id :
-------------------------------------------------
4.git config --global user.name "user-name"

5.git config --global user.email "mail-id"

To check whether user name and mail id or set :
--------------------------------------------------
6.git config --global user.name

7.git config --global user.email

8.git commit -m "msg"

9.git log or git log --oneline :- to check a commit history

10.To add a remote repo

git remote add origin <url>

11.To check the connection with remote repositroy

git remote -v

12.to push a local changes to remote

git push origin <branch-name>




=====================================================================
Repostory :- wddm12

1.working directory :-  we have created one file with the name of demo1
 
      demo1 

2. Staging area :- it is like a mock system so here before sotring a version
                   for review purpose we will a source code here..

     to add a file from working directory to staging area we need to add a 
     command called

git add <file-name> or git add .(to add all files)

3.local repository :- To store a changes in local repository called .git

To transfer the file from staging area to local repo we need to commit

git commit -m "valid msg"

Error :- 
Author identity unknown *** Please tell me who you are. 
Run git config --global user.email "you@example.com" 
git config --global user.name "Your Name" 
to set your account's default identity. 
Omit --global to set the identity only in this repository.

4.Remote repository :
-------------------------
To transfer the file from local repo to remote repo we need to push the local
changes to remote ...

git push origin <branch-name>

git remote add origin <url>
