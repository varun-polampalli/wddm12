User management :-
------------------
User management will play a important role in operating system
IAM :- identity access management 

like me and my brother 

user :- user1

user :- user2 


we can create a user in 3 ways 

1.GUI :- Graphical user interface  
2.CLI :- Command line interpretor 
3./etc/passwd :- By modifying/editing the file.

1.sudo su :- 

sudo is a super user --Root 
------------

2.useradd :- To create a user 

synatx :- useradd <user-name>

when we create a user at that time our system will create a directory with 
a user name in home directory ..

To check whether user is created or not 

vi /etc/passwd 
cat /etc/passwd
nano /etc/passwd
